This is a collection of source code that I rather like using in Objective-C.

It's all licensed under the MIT license. This has not been rigorously tested
nor is it guaranteed to be performant in any way. It's simply meant to be a
useful collection of things.

All source code requires the use of automatic reference counting (-fobjc-arc).

See COPYING or the header of any source file for license details.
